# Prework-Study-Guide

## Description

The Prework Study Guide was created in order to provide a place for notes and to better understand the many facets of the web dev environment. The guide also provided a bridge to understand the potential of coding essentials such as functions, control flow and loops.

This guide provides a central location for many key notes on the subjects of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript, as well as a platform to execute JS code via the console within the browser. I learned much about the basics of the aforementioned areas of computer programming by creating this study guide.

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide can be used in a couple of ways. First, the main page contains notes grouped by their corresponding subject area. Second, upon opening the console in the browser (default Chrome DevTools; Command+Option+I for macOS, Control+Shift+I for Windows) the user will be able to view the list of topics learned in the bootcamp prework along with a randomized suggestion on which of these topics to view first. This feature also exemplifies the functionality of JavaScript.
