        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>HTML is the framework of the website; a well-built frame results in a well-built house (i.e. website)</li>
          <li>Element and tag are often used interchangeably, even though they refer to slightly different things</li>
          <li>Elements can contain multiple attributes in their opening tags</li>
          <li>Open code in a live browser often to: 1. make sure the page(s) are rendering correctly, and 2. assist in the debugging process</li>
          <li>We can use semantic HTML elements to indicate the role of their content, as well as to give structure to the content of the webpage</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS defines colors, aesthetics, visual layout and organization by assigning style rules for specific HTML elements</li>
          <li>3 ways to incorporate CSS: inline (style attribute) CSS, internal ("style" element within HTML "head" element) CSS & external CSS ("link" open tag element in HTML "head" element; preferred; keeps all CSS rules in a separate file)</li>
          <li>CSS Rule = selector (defines element or attribute) followed by property(s) and associated value(s)</li>
          <li>CSS Box Model = every HTML element is a box, consisting from outer to inner CSS properties of: margin, border, padding, content</li>
          <li>A ".___" selector is a class selector where only certain elements are styled with the CSS rule if assigned the associated class attribute</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently in</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: adds all files within the working branch to staging area</li>
          <li>git commit -m: commits files (w/ associated changes) to the repository</li>
          <li>code .: opens VSCode and all code elements within the working directory</li>
          <li>Git flow = add -> commit -> push up to feature (or other) comparison branch -> open PR -> merge into main (base) branch</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Variables are containers for data types (primitive or complex), which are stored as values</li>
          <li>console.log() = console refers to a test environment; .log() is a method, which is a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer</li>
          <li>Control flow = order in which a computer executes code in a script; highway analogy; conditional logic can be used to alter the linear flow of code as well as return to it</li>
          <li>Once a truthy condition is met the computer will run the code associated with that condition and then "break out" of the conditional statement</li>
          <li>Falsy values = 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN or Boolean false</li>
          <li>Interrupting control flow is the basis of building apps that respond to user actions</li>
          <li>Arrays are variables that hold multiple data values that are typically related; useful for performing tasks on multiple pieces of data at once; data is stored via a zero-index and sequential within the array</li>
          <li>loops (i.e. 'for') perform tasks on all items in an array by allowing a single code block to iterate over and over; x < array.length is a Boolean value</li>
        </ul>
